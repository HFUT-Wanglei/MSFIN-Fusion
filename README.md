# MSFIN
This package contains the source code which is associated with the following paper:

Yu Liu, Lei Wang, Juan Cheng, Xun Chen, "Multi-scale Feature Interactive Network for Multi-focus Image Fusion", submitted to IEEE Transactions on Instrumentation and Measurement, 2021. (under review, second round)

Edited by Yu Liu.   

Usage of this code is free for research purposes only. 

The MSFIN model is learned by pytorch. The training code will be released if the paper could be accepted for publication. 

Thank you.



#### **Requirements**:

- CUDA  10

- Python  3.6

- Torch  1.8.1

- Torchvison  0.9.1
